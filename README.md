# gene_family_conflicts
scripts to investigate gene tree conflict with gene families


## Introduction

This repository contains the gene_tree_conflict.py program designed to detect conflict using orthologs (orthologous gene trees) or gene families (Homologous gene trees). The program can either map a series of gene trees onto the species tree to identify the amount of conflict the gene trees have, map a species onto a gene tree to investigate where the gene tree has conflict, or search for patterns of conflict. A more detailed description of all the programs features may be found in the manual.
